    My name is... and i live in Madrid
    I work for Vizzuality as Frontend developer
    Sorry for my english... Ill do my best, the slides will be available online.

2) In this presentation...
    I wanna show you some projects we have developed
    And use them to show some new great functionalities available through HTML5
    
3) What is HTML5
    Everybody should know by now, but for those who dont, is a new set of funcitonalities available on new browsers
    like Video, Canvas, CSS3, etc.

4) Where can I use HTML5?
    -IE 9, Safari... etc.
    -Some technologies appeared before than others in different browsers versions.

5) Evolution of the Web (DEMO)
    -And one project we released some weeks ago comes very handy. So you can see where the different technolgoies become availble on the different browsers
    -And if you need to see on detail when it becoma evailble take a look at youcanuseit.
    
6) So let me show you some projects we have been working on where we use some of this functionality

7) Home de GeoCAT
    -GeocAT is a Rich Internet Application to Perform geospatial analysis of endangered species data.
    -That is, it is a tool to help scientist to find out if a species is endangered or not, and if it has to be protected.
    -So it is a great resposansibility, the best the tool works, the more species are protected.

8) EDITOR DEMO

    9.1) Infowindows
    9.2) Tools


10) IMAZON screenshot
    -We have been working on this project with Google. The objetive is to validate the results of deforestation models in the Amazonas.
    -The most interesting part of this project to me is the way we are using Canvas to render raster data dynamically on the browser
    -Something I really like is that we implemented something similar 2 yrs. ago but we had to use Flash because HTML5 was not hat stablished and tbrowsers where not fast enough.
    Now, the HTML5 version runs faster in JS in Chrome or Safari than in Flash.
    (DEMO compare http://mountainbiodiversity.org/tool.html#/4_33.57_87.98/2220_7889/200_3397/1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1/All) AGAINST

12) Snipets
    -VisualRaster: Using Canvas
    -CORS: Google Maps and Google Earth Engine already have it. Something that OSM MapQuest would be nice to add.
    ....
